## Questions
Q: What is the purpose of this<br>
A: I'm just trying to have some fun coding C#, it probably won't be the fastest server neither the best

Q: Can this serve as a full SMTP server replacement<br>
A: I guess when its done? Right now it will receive email just fine but thats about it

Q: Can I help?<br>
A: Sure, there are lots of things to do. Just check the SMTP specification and find stuff that is missing from my code and implement it (or find one of the million bugs), then submit a pull request<br>
Keep in mind I really try to focus on following the RFC specifications, so try to keep it as close to the specification as possible

Q: Future plans / goals?<br>
A: I really want to make a SMTP server and a IMAP server so it can actually serve as a full mailserver replacement.
